ppt (0.1-0archeos1) therodoric; urgency=low

  * Initial release
  * Some minor fix in scripts
  * Camera database is now a proper dot file: on runtime
    it's copied from install dir to ~/.ppt. 
    It fix the need to have a writable file in the
    /usr/share/directory and now each user have his own database.
  * Default behavior when running pmvs is to remove old pmvs dir.
